## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

<ul>
    <li><b>Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?</b></li>
        Vehicle weight, spoiler angle, and AWD are the variables with a pr(>|t|) value larger than the significance level of 0.05, which provides a non-random amount of variance.
    <li><b>Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?</b></li>
        The slope of the linear model is not considered zero because the p-value is 5.35e-11, which is lower than the significance level of 0.05.
    <li><b>Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?</b></li>
        The R-squared value is 0.7149, meaning that this linear model predicts the mpg of MechaCar prototypes correctly approximately 71% of the time.  Overall, the model is an effective predicter of mpg, although the 29% of variance left could be minimized with further analysis.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

<ul>
    <li><b>The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?</b></li>

According to the total summary, the current variance of the suspension coils is 69.29, which is lower than the limit of 100 PSI.  However, the lot summary shows that, while lots 1 and 2 are well below the required variance, lot 3 has a variance of 170.29, which is significantly above the maximum variance allowed.
</ul>

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils

In order to determine if the PSI across all manufacturing lots is statistically different from the population mean of 1,500 pounds per square inch, we had to perform 4 separate T-Tests: the first for all lots, and then for the first, second, and third lots individually.

As you can see in the above images, the T-Tests performed for All Lots, Lot 1, and Lot 2 all came yielded a p-values larger than our significance level of 0.05 (0.06, 1, and 0.61, respectively), meaning these categories do not statistically differ from the population mean of 1,500 PSI.  Lot 3, on the other hand, returned a p-value of 0.04 which is smaller than our significance level of 0.05, meaning Lot 3's PSI is statistically different from the population mean.
