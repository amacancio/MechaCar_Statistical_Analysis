## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

<ul>
    <li>Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?</li>
    Vehicle weight, spoiler angle, and AWD all provided a non-random amount of variance.

    <li>Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?</li>
    

    <li>Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?</li>
